      "body": "In the Romanian renewable energy market, the fundamental determinant of project value is the alignment between paper-based design and actual grid capacity. While market practices often focus on development perspectives, AFA filters projects through technical mechanisms structured around investor and financing standards. Grid conditions encountered during or after the Technical Connection Approval (ATR) stage directly impact investment economics. Therefore, the evaluation model relies not only on permitting status but on thresholds of evacuation capability, deliverability, and bankability. We do not assume developer or EPC contractor roles. This approach ensures independent verification free from conflicts of interest."
